# SOA-web-portal--Revised-MERN-Developement-
MERN stack version of my thesis project in college 

A very simple app of my own development
It covers many code practice from express (server, api routes, validations, file upload, etc...)
to react (react-hooks, material-ui, react-redux, class components, server side rendering, calendar, dom manipulation, etc.)

The reason the student is just a built-in account is because of the issue in our college that we will have the access of all the accounts of students in university.
But the management didn't give us permission so I created my own version of the app (as my portfolio XD).

SOA (Student Organization and Activities)

# The Portal have 4 types of users:
1. Students (for now, it's a built in account)
2. Student Organizations
3. SOA Heads
4  SOA Admin

# The roles of students in the web app are: 
- Report Lost & Found Items
- View Calendar of Events
- Join Activities of the university
- Download files being shared by SOA admin

# The roles of student organizations in web app are:
